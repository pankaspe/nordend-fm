## Why Nordend

Nordend talks to the compositor directly, with **no toolkit at all**: text, icons, scrolling and
animations come from its own renderer. It takes your desktop's light or dark style and accent
colour; on Noctalia (Noctalia Shell, the Umbriel compositor) it wears your Noctalia theme, live,
once Noctalia is told to write it ([two steps](#on-noctalia)).

- **Fast.** The first frame in about 65 ms, a 10 000-file folder in 0.7 ms, a raw photo in
  Quick Look in under 100 ms. Every figure is measured, with the tool to measure it again.
- **Light.** A 3 MB binary, 17 libraries, about 25 MB of memory, and no CPU at all while
  nothing moves.
- **Safe with what it reads.** Files that come from outside are read by `nordend-preview`, a
  small helper process in a cage of Nordend's own (seccomp and landlock: no files, no network,
  no programs). A broken or hostile file costs at most its preview; Nordend carries on.
- **Its own readers.** TIFF (LZW, Deflate, PackBits, JPEG, tiles, BigTIFF), PGM and PPM are
  read by code written for Nordend, checked pixel for pixel against libtiff and fuzzed; PNG, JPEG
  and GIF by [wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs), memory-safe by construction. Raw files
  show the JPEG their camera stored, so the camera's own rendering; a DNG whose stored previews
  are too small is developed by Nordend's own reader, with the file's own colour.
- **Photos and their editors.** Thumbnails, the info pane and Quick Look with the shot's EXIF
  and rating; darktable sidecars travel with their photo through every rename, copy, move and
  trip to the trash.
- **Three views of the same folder.** Columns, a thumbnail grid and a details table
  (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd>); switching keeps your place and your
  selection. Sort by name, size, date or type from the context menu, in every view.
- **Tabs.** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>, or a middle click on a folder to open it behind the
  one you are in; each tab keeps its folder, view and history, and they all come back at the next
  start.
- **Careful with your files.** Nothing overwritten without asking, nothing half-copied under a
  real name, a real freedesktop trash, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>.
- **Keyboard first, mouse always.** Every action has a key (<kbd>F1</kbd> lists them) and a click.

Everything it does is in [docs/features.md](docs/features.md); inside Nordend, <kbd>F1</kbd> lists
every shortcut.

## Features

- **Views:** columns, thumbnail grid, details table; tabs; zoom; sort by name, size, date or type
- **Quick Look** (<kbd>Space</kbd>): photos fill the window, raw files included; text files on a
  scrollable page; the arrows walk the folder
- **Raw files:** the previews cameras embed in ORF, CR2, NEF, ARW, RAF, RW2, SRW, DNG, 3FR
  (found by Nordend's own reader), upright and cropped to the shot; DNGs with only a small
  preview (Leica, drones) developed by Nordend itself; EXIF in the info pane
- **Images:** PNG, JPEG, GIF (wuffs), WebP, JPEG XL, and TIFF, PGM and PPM with Nordend's own
  readers; thumbnails in the shared freedesktop cache
- **Isolated reading:** every picture is made in a caged helper process, never in Nordend
- **darktable:** sidecars follow their photo everywhere; ratings shown
- **Command palette** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>): every command, place and tab, fuzzy-matched
  (fzy), the recently used first
- **Find files** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>): fuzzy search of every file under the folder,
  first results in milliseconds even among 270 000; Enter shows it, Space opens Quick Look
- **Files:** copy and move with progress and conflict questions, rename, new folder or file
  from templates, undo and redo, freedesktop trash with restore, delete permanently
- **Drag and drop** within Nordend and with other apps; rubber-band selection; the system
  clipboard
- **Sidebar:** places, GTK bookmarks, disks through udisks2 (mount, unmount, eject)
- **Opening:** default applications and "Open With", resolved exactly as GLib does; a terminal
  in any folder (<kbd>F4</kbd>)
- **Always current:** folders follow changes on disk (inotify); history with
  <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> and the mouse's side buttons
- **Looks:** Noctalia's theme live (through [a template](#on-noctalia)), or the desktop's
  light/dark style and accent (GNOME, Plasma);
  its icon follows the accent; fractional scaling; its own title bar where needed
- **Remembers** views, order, tabs and window size; a short `config.toml`, reloaded live

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Binary | **3.95 MB** (3.28 MB stripped), x86-64; the decoders and text readers in `nordend-preview`, 1.13 MB (1.01 stripped), a separate caged helper |
| Libraries | 17 direct (the helper: 8); no GTK, no Qt, no GLib |
| Code | about 51 300 lines of C++20, 17 400 of tests (420 test cases, under ASan and TSan too) |
| Memory | **25 MB** of its own at start; pictures are decoded in the helpers, which give their memory back after a quiet second |
| Idle | **0 CPU**: nothing is drawn while nothing moves |

## Benchmarks

The design's four targets, measured on 2026-11-01 (Ryzen 7 5700G, RX 6650 XT, SATA SSD):

| Target | Measured |
|--------|---------:|
| Cold start to the first frame on screen: < 150 ms | **128 ms** (warm: **64 ms**) |
| A 10 000-file folder: first frame < 50 ms | first entries in **0.7 ms**, all in **17 ms** |
| Quick Look of an ORF raw photo: < 100 ms | **82-96 ms** |
| Scrolling with no dropped frame | worst frame **3.7 ms** of 13.3 (75 Hz) |

Every measurement and its method is in [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Install

Nordend needs Linux with a Wayland compositor that offers xdg-shell (developed on Umbriel, also
tried on GNOME, Plasma and niri) and a GPU driver with OpenGL ES 3.0 (Mesa).

### On Void Linux

Nordend is developed on Void, and comes with an xbps-src template in
[`packaging/void`](packaging/void). It builds the latest release into a package that puts
`nordend`, its desktop entry and its icon under `/usr`:

```sh
# 1. void-packages, once (skip if you already have a checkout)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages
cd void-packages
./xbps-src binary-bootstrap

# 2. Nordend's template, then the package
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm /tmp/nordend-fm
cp -r /tmp/nordend-fm/packaging/void/nordend srcpkgs/
./xbps-src pkg nordend
sudo xbps-install -R hostdir/binpkgs nordend
```

The package is the latest release, **0.5.0**. What `main` gains after it comes with the next
release; to have it at once, build from source.

### From source

On Void Linux the packages are these; elsewhere, the development packages of the same libraries
(their names differ and have not been tried yet):

```sh
sudo xbps-install -S cmake ninja pkgconf wayland-devel wayland-protocols \
    libxkbcommon-devel libglvnd-devel MesaLib-devel \
    harfbuzz-devel freetype-devel fontconfig-devel tomlplusplus-devel \
    libwebp-devel libjxl-devel zlib-devel sdbus-c++-devel
git clone https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm
cd nordend-fm
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/nordend            # your home folder, or ./build/nordend ~/Pictures
cmake --install build --prefix ~/.local --strip   # nordend, its desktop entry and icon
```

### Then

Make it the default for folders (a browser's "Show in folder", `xdg-open`) and give it a key:

```sh
xdg-mime default nordend.desktop inode/directory
```

```toml
# Umbriel's config.toml; other compositors have their own way
"Mod+E" = { action = "spawn nordend", repeat = false }
```

### On Noctalia

Nordend takes its colours from `~/.config/nordend/colors.toml`, and Noctalia writes that file
through a template, on every theme change. Noctalia does not have the template yet, so tell it
once:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/noctalia/templates ~/.config/nordend
cp /usr/share/nordend/noctalia/nordend ~/.config/noctalia/templates/
# installed in ~/.local or not at all: ~/.local/share/nordend/noctalia/nordend, or
# data/noctalia/nordend in this repository
```

```toml
# ~/.config/noctalia/config.toml
[theme.templates.user.nordend]
input_path  = "templates/nordend"
output_path = "~/.config/nordend/colors.toml"
```

Then pick a theme in Noctalia (or the same one again): Nordend changes with it, live. Without
`colors.toml`, Nordend follows the desktop's light or dark style and accent instead, where the
desktop's portal offers them (GNOME, Plasma), else its own default palette.

Configuration: every key, with its default, in [docs/config.example.toml](docs/config.example.toml)
(copy it to `~/.config/nordend/config.toml`; `nordend --check-config` reports any problem). The
command line: `nordend [DIR]`, `--config FILE`, `--version`, and `--about` (what Nordend runs on,
for a bug report).

## Versions

Nordend stays at 0.x while it is young. A new **minor** version (0.2.0, 0.3.0…) brings features
you can see; a **patch** (0.2.1) only fixes things. 1.0.0 will come once Nordend has been its
author's everyday file manager for a while and its files (`config.toml`, `state.toml`) have
settled.

| Version | What it brought |
|---|---|
| on `main`, next | Grid thumbnails up to 512 px, sharp from the larger caches (icons stay at 256); builds hardened on every system (stack protection, full RELRO, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3`, the standard library's index checks) |
| [0.5.0](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.5.0), 2026-11-09 | Text previews: text files in Quick Look and the info pane, read in the caged helper (UTF-8, UTF-16, Latin-1) with syntax colours from your theme for C, C++, Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, Luau, shell (heredocs included), fish, CMake, Makefiles, JSON, TOML, YAML, INI files and desktop entries, `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`, Markdown (code blocks in their own language) and diffs; select with the pointer, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C; long lines scroll sideways; Home, End, Page Up and Page Down; a caption with the language, encoding and line ends; minified files shown plain; logs opened at their newest lines. The helper became the first engine, described by a manifest |
| [0.4.0](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.4.0), 2026-11-08 | Image previews read by Nordend's own code: DNG developed when its previews are too small (Leica M240 and M8, DJI drones, Adobe-converted files) with the file's colour, tone curve, vignetting and lens corrections, read identically to LibRaw and 2-4 times faster; TIFF with its own reader (BigTIFF, LZW, Deflate, PackBits, JPEG, 8/16-bit and float, CMYK, tiles, a scanner's scan in a SubIFD); raw files' previews and the info pane's EXIF without exiv2 (the same results, 3 to 100 times quicker); pictures made in small `nordend-preview` processes, each in a cage of Nordend's own (seccomp and landlock), so a file that crashes or hangs one costs only its preview; one path for every picture, told by the file's bytes; a plain sentence when a file cannot be shown. Canon CRW and Minolta MRW get that sentence; darktable sidecars' ratings are no longer read (Nordend's own ratings come next) |
| [0.3.1](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.3.1), 2026-11-07 | Fixes: DNG previews stored as a JPEG inside a TIFF (Leica M240, Samsung GX20 at full size), broken previews passed over for the next one (Samsung SRW), PGM and PPM images, a plain message for raw formats with no readable preview (Sigma X3F, old Panasonic RAW) |
| [0.3.0](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.3.0), 2026-11-06 | The command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, fuzzy matching with fzy); finding files under a folder (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>); Nordend's icon follows the desktop's accent colour (`icon.follow_accent`) |
| [0.2.0](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.2.0), 2026-11-06 | Sort By in the context menu; tabs (a folder, a view, a history and a zoom each, remembered); zoom in the columns and the details |
| [0.1.0](https://github.com/pankaspe/nordend-fm/releases/tag/v0.1.0), 2026-11-06 | The first release: three views, raw previews and Quick Look, file operations with undo, trash, drag and drop, disks, the desktop's look |

## What's next

Nordend stays what it is: a native C++ file manager, made for Noctalia Shell, with no GTK or Qt;
very light, safe and fast. Everything else is a feature on top, added only when it keeps those
three.

0.1.0 came out after a week of daily use by the author; 0.2.0 added Sort By, tabs and zoom in the
lists; 0.3.0 the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>) and finding files
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>); 0.3.1 more raw previews; 0.4.0 image previews read by Nordend's own
code in caged helpers; 0.5.0 text previews with syntax colours, selecting and copying. Coming,
roughly in this order: **previews, one family at a time**: other common formats one by one (SVG,
AVIF, fonts, archive contents, audio tags).
After that: colour labels and star ratings of your own, not tied to any raw editor; a Quick Look
for photographers (100 % zoom, EXIF, histogram, comparison); a dual pane, a queue of operations
and batch renaming; translations, a file chooser for other applications, plugins in Luau (one
system, each plugin caged; heavy formats such as PDF and video, and local AI search, as separate
engines).
